# Client-Location-Sorting-Algorithm
This project focuses on sorting your companies client locations into the three major business regions of the world (AMER, APAC, EMER). This is useful for companies trying to assign their regional branches to the correct clients. For example, if a company had a branch that managed the APAC clients, this algorithm will sort the overall comapnies clients to give that branch just the APAC clients. The objectives of this project were to create an algorithm that could successfully import an excel file and data, sort it based on calling code, and export the sorted data to a new excel file. Within this repository, you will find the base data that I used, the algorithm, the sorted data, and a file with all countries with their corresponding calling code. This last file is to be used to convert the calling codes back to country names. This program utilizes the use of MATLAB. A similar algorithm could be made in other languages, but MATLAB has many built in functions that make making this algorithm easier.
